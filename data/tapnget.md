    *   `image_url` (VARCHAR(255))
        *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
        *   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

4.  **Orders Table (`orders`):**
    *   Captures order information (ID, restaurant ID, table number, order date, status).
    *   `id` (INT, primary key, auto-increment)
    *   `restaurant_id` (INT, foreign key referencing `restaurants.id`, not null)
