## 3. Summary

"Otalku" is a mobile social media application designed specifically for anime enthusiasts ("weebs"). It provides functionalities for users to connect with each other, share their passion for anime, interact through posting, commenting, chatting, and even arranging local events. It was built using Flutter with Firebase as its backend, and deployed to Android and iOS. These metrics reflect a smaller user base of 70 users, and the versions were adjusted to reflect 2020 environment.

**Application Specifications:**

*   **Platform:** Cross-platform mobile application (Android and iOS).
*   **Technology:** Built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for backend services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for user management.
*   **Database:** Firebase Cloud Firestore for storing user data, posts, comments, chats, guilds and events.
*   **Media Storage:** Firebase Storage for storing user-uploaded media (images, videos).
*   **Real-time Updates:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization across all clients.
*   **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Functions to send notifications.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   User profiles with profile pictures, bios, locations, and starlight points.
    *   Follow system for connecting with other users.
    *   Starlight points system for rewarding posts, comments, and other users.
    *   Feed functionality for users to post anime-related content.
    *   Commenting on posts.
    *   Direct chat between users with multimedia support.
    *   Guild creation and guild-specific posts/chat
    *   Event creation and event invites/attendees.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store using Codemagic.

**Performance Summary**

*   **DAU (Daily Active Users):** 45
*   **MAU (Monthly Active Users):** 70
*   **Retention Rate (1 week):** 30%
*   **Retention Rate (1 month):** 15%
*   **Average Session Length:** 8 minutes
*  **Average Post per day:** 10+
*  **Average Comments per day:** 30+
*   **Average Chat Messages Per Day:** 100+
*    **Average Starlight Points Given Per Day:** 100+
*  **Average Guilds Created per Week:** 1+
  * **Average Events Created per Week:** 0+
*   **Crash Rate:** < 1%
*   **Average load time:** < 2 seconds
* **Average API response time:** < 300ms

Otalku provides a platform for anime enthusiasts to connect, share, and form communities, however due to a smaller user base it needs to focus on strategies that will increase user engagement and retention, and also needs to address the tech stack compatibility with older versions.

## 4. Architecture

*This section remains the same as it describes the app architecture*

**Data Flow and System Architecture:**

1.  **User Interaction (Flutter Frontend):**
    *   Users interact with the Otalku mobile app built with Flutter.
    *   They can browse profiles, view feeds, create posts, make comments, chat, and create guilds and events.
    *   Media files are picked using the Image Picker and Video Picker library.

2.  **Data Requests and Updates:**
    *   The Flutter app sends requests to Firebase (Cloud Firestore, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Authentication) via the Firebase SDKs and data is managed via Provider State management.
    *   These requests can be to fetch data (e.g., user profiles, posts, chat messages), submit data (e.g., new posts, comments), and make changes (e.g., updating profiles, giving starlight points).
    *    The application caches the data in memory to minimize the database retrieval.

3.  **Backend Services (Firebase):**
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** Manages user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
    *   **Cloud Firestore:** Serves as the NoSQL database. Data is stored in collections and documents and is structured as described previously (users, posts, comments, etc.).
    *   **Firebase Storage:** Handles the storage of images and videos uploaded by users. The app uploads the media to firebase storage and then saves the URL in Firestore documents.
    *   **Cloud Functions:** Used for server-side logic, such as sending notifications for new messages, or when someone follows a user. It is also used for updating user activities.

4. **Real-time Data Synchronization:**
    *  Firebase Firestore allows real-time data synchronization. This means any change made on the data reflects on every device instantly.

5.  **Admin Interface:**
    *   There is no explicit admin interface for Otalku yet, but the Firebase console allows the admin to view user data, manage the Firestore database, view storage, and set-up Firebase Cloud Functions.
